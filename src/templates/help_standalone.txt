Brainfuck application

This is a natively compiled Brainfuck application.

Options:
  --memory=<n> (default: 1000000)
      Number of memory cells. Start cell is in the middle.
      As the operating system's paging mechanism is used to sandbox
      the Brainfuck application, the number of cells will be rounded
      up to match the minimum page size.
  --io.binary
      Print cells directly as bytes.
  --io.prompt
      Print prompt symbol when the application does read operations.
  --io.eof=xx (default: 00)
      Hexadecimal value of byte returned on read operations on EOF.
      When not in interactive mode, reading again after receiving
      EOF will exit the program.
  -h, --help
