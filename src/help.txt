Brainiac {s} - Brainfuck interpreter/compiler/profiler/transpiler

Usage: brainiac [options] [sourcefile]
Where sourcefile is a Brainfuck source code file. If not given,
source code will instead be read from stdin and executed directly.

Brainfuck language reference:
 + Increment cell by one
 - Decrement cell by one
 > Switch to next cell
 < Switch to previous cell
 . Print cell
 , Read input character into cell
 [ Jump to matching ] when current cell is zero
 ] Jump to matching [ when current cell is not zero

Options:
  --interpret (default)
      Interpret source code.
  --compile
      Compile source code for the native architecture and run it.
      Supported architectures: riscv64, x86_64.
  --profile
      After interpreting the code, write HTML performance report of
      the source code into a file named <sourcefile>.profile.htm.
  --transpile
      Translate given Brainfuck source code into C code and print
      a standalone C file ready for compilation. 
  --hexdump
      Instead of running the compiled executable print generated
      machine code in hexadecimal form.
  --interactive
      After executing the sourcefile, switch to interactive mode.
  --limit=<n>
      Limit execution to n (optimized) instructions.
      Only available with --interpret and --profile.
  --cell=8|16|32|64 (default: 8)
      Memory cell size in bits.
  --memory=<n> (default: 1000000)
      Number of memory cells. Start cell is in the middle.
      As the operating system's paging mechanism is used to sandbox
      the Brainfuck application, the number of cells will be rounded
      up to match the minimum page size.
  -O0 Disable all optimizations.
  -O1 Allow simple optimizations:
       - Fold sequences of "+", "-", ">" and "<" into one opcode.
  -O2 Allow loop optimizations:
       - Convert "[-]" loops followed by one or more "+" or "-"
         into a single set value operation.
  -O3 Allow advanced optimizations:
       - Convert loops like "[<->>++>>+++<<<-]" into one or more
         multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations followed by set=0.
  -O4 (default)
       - Merge move operations into other operators as an offset.
  --io.binary
      Print cells directly as bytes.
  --io.prompt
      Print prompt symbol when the application does read operations.
  --io.eof=xx (default: 00)
      Hexadecimal value of byte returned on read operations on EOF.
      When not in interactive mode, reading again after receiving
      EOF will exit the program.
  --verbose
      Print additional information like number of parsed
      instructions, optimization results etc.
  --quiet
      Do not print first status line with execution information.
  -h, --help
      Show this help text.
  --version
      Show brainiac version.
